# Answer 3: consecutive runs for the same value

Similar to answer 2, `Decode` followed by `Encode` does not produce the original stream of integers
when the input stream contains two or more consecutive runs for the same value. For example

```
< 1, 1, 1, 1 >

```
decodes to:
```
< 1, 1 >

```
which encodes to:
```
< 2, 1 >

```
which is not the same as the original stream.

This is tested by `testDoubleRun` in
[DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java](../tests/src/test/java/integration/DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java).

Another example of this answer uses consecutive runs of the same value with a total count larger than the
maximum positive integer in Java, but this would be difficult to test: it would either take too long or run out of
memory.

The final answer is pretty obscure. If you need it, here's a [hint](./.HINT4.md).
