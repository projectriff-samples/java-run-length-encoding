# Answer 1: decode failures

`Decode` followed by `Encode` does not produce the original stream of integers when the input stream cannot
be decoded. For example, an odd number of items in the input stream cannot be decoded and so:

```
< 0 >

```
decodes to the following stream (where `^` denotes error termination):
```
< ^

```
which, in turn, encodes to the following stream:
```
< ^

```
which is not the same as the original stream.

This is tested by `testCountWithNoValue` in
[DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java](../tests/src/test/java/integration/DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java).


Another example of a decode failure involves a negative count:
```
< -1, 0 >
```
decodes to (where `^` denotes error termination):
```
< ^
```
which encodes to:
```
< ^
```
 
This is tested by `testNegativeCount` in
[DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java](../tests/src/test/java/integration/DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java).


This answer is probably the most obvious. Can you think of other answers?
