# Answer 2: zero length runs

Another case where `Decode` followed by `Encode` does not produce the original stream of integers
when the input stream contains one or more runs of length 0. For example

```
< 0, 1 >

```
decodes to the empty stream:
```
< >

```
which encodes to the empty stream:
```
< >

```
which is not the same as the original stream.

This is tested by `testDegenerateRun` in
[DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java](../tests/src/test/java/integration/DecodeEncodeRoundTripTests.java). 

But, we're not done yet. Can you think of another answer?
