# Edge cases
`Encode` followed by `Decode` does not produce the original stream of integers in the following edge cases:
1. When a non-empty input stream "hangs", i.e. when no more items are added to the input stream
and the stream does not terminate.
2. In some cases where the input stream ends in error (see [issue 2](https://github.com/projectriff-samples/java-run-length-encoding/issues/2)).
3. When the size of a run exceeds the maximum value of the integer type used in the implementation.
4. When `Encode` or `Decode` runs out of memory.
